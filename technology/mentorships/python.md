# Lesson Plan

1. Basic Programming
>Learn the basics of python! We will go over some basic programming concepts and how to implement them in python.

2. File I/O ( input/output )
>Use features of your operating system to interface, read & write files. This is useful in gathering data from arbitrary sources, processing said data, and exporting it in a meaningful form factor.
---
3. Intermediate Programming
>Expand on the knowledge previously. We will also use more complex data types to structure data in a more intuitive way.
---
4. Putting your knowledge to the test!
>We will write a program that will use all of the topics we have previously covered and give an insight into what programming is all about solving problems
