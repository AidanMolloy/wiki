We run mentorships every year to give students a sample of technology they don't get to learn in college

You can sign-up for current mentorships or view the notes from previous ones below

*Taught by*: __Thomas__

Learn the Python Programming Language by building a mini-project, read and write files to automate your study.
Learn webscraping to find out when you need to submit that assignment that's coming up. And learn to plot some graphs demonstrating how much fun you've had learning Python
