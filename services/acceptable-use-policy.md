## Acceptable Usage
* No pornography of any kind
* No gore or violence-related imagery, videos or documents
* No hate speech
* No personal attacks
* No copyrighted material
* Nothing that violates the laws of Ireland
* Nothing that violates the UCC IT Acceptable Usage Policy (http://www.ucc.ie/aup)

## You must:
* not use our services or resources to knowingly access
    or distribute illegal or inappropriate material,
    including material that is in any way pornographic,
    obscene, abusive, racist, libellous, defamatory or
    threatening.

* Not engage in any form of bullying or other behaviour
    which is illegal or likely to
    cause harassment to others.

* Not use computer or network resources for the purpose
    of gaining unauthorised access to the account, systems
    or equipment of any third party - attempts at ‘hacking’
    may result in criminal prosecution in Ireland or elsewhere

* Not share user IDs or usernames, transfer them to other
    users, divulge your passwords to other users, seek to
    impersonate other users or leave your computer unattended,
    even for a short period of time, without logging out or
    locking out as appropriate

* Not knowingly introduce any virus, malware or other
    destructive program or device into the University’s systems
    or network and you should take all reasonable steps to
    ensure that you do not inadvertently introduce such programs
    or devices into the systems or network

## Monitoring

Network traffic is monitored in circumstances where there is
reason to suspect that this AUP is being breached, for the
purposes of backups and problem solving or where UCC Netsoc
has other legitimate reasons for doing so. You
must therefore be aware that such monitoring is taking place.

## Account Lifespan

Your user accounts are guaranteed to exist for the duration of
your studies in UCC but in the event that space becomes an
issue in the future, accounts may be terminated (with prior
notice through email or facebook and twitter).
